	<b>Brief statement: </b>George Boole invented a form of algebra called <q>Boolean logic</q>. While researching about mathematic and logic, he started to see the similarities between algebra and logic, and he then tried to use algebra in logical problems. He looked at the problems from the ancient philosopher Aristotle and realized that all of those statements are either <q>true</q> or <q>false</q>. The 3 basic operations for this <q>Boolean logic</q> are <q>AND</q>, <q>OR</q>, and <q>NOT</q>. And with only these operators, we can compare and controls all variables that we have. Because the binary system was already existing, he connected his algebra to this system by forming opposite pairs of objects like <q>true-false</q> and <q>zero-one</q> which are some of the most important parts of computer science now. We do not know if he had any idea that his invention will become the central part of computer science but his goal was very big, he wanted to use this concept to model the brain of human which is what we are trying to do using science and technology based on his invention.
